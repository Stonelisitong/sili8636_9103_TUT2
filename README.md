## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration
I was inspired by *Anamorphic Art Installations** by **Michael Murphy*. This illusion art achieves a 3D visual effect through perspective and distortion. 
It gave me some ideas for my work:
-I hope to incorporate this **3D visual effect** into my project. 
-As users drag the screen and rotate the graphics, the pieces align and reveal a breathtaking image. Users can deeply experience the **immersive feeling** brought by the artwork. 
-Also, **fragmented images** can be composed of **metaphorical objects** to convey the essence of the work more effectively.
