## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration
I was inspired by *[The Work of Michael Murphy](https://www.perceptualart.com/)*.\
This illusion art achieves a 3D visual effect through perspective and distortion.\
![Anamorphic Art 1](readmeImages/Anamorphic%20Art%201.png)\
![Anamorphic Art 2](readmeImages/Anamorphic%20Art%202.png)\
![Anamorphic Art 3](readmeImages/Anamorphic%20Art%203.png)\
![Anamorphic Art 4](readmeImages/Anamorphic%20Art%204.png)\
These artworks gave me some ideas for my work:\
-I hope to incorporate this **3D Visual Effect** into my project. This technology helps to give artworks depth, extending beyond just the screen of a mobile phone.\
-Users can deeply experience the **Immersive Feeling** brought by the artwork.\
-Also, **Fragmented Images** can be composed of **Metaphorical Objects** to convey the essence of the work more effectively.
## Part 2: Imaging Technique Inspiration
I found coding techniques on *[p5.js](https://p5js.org/examples/3d-orbit-control.html)* that can help me achieve the imaging technology mentioned in the first part.\
![Coding](readmeImages/Coding%20.mov)
I can set up a 3D camera using Orbit Control. This technology allows users to appreciate the artwork from a **First-person Perspective**.\ 
Graphic fragments are designed to be distributed along the orbit. When users **Drag** the screen and **Rotate** the graphics, they can discover the image formed by the fragments and deeply experience the **Immersive Feeling** brought by the artwork.\
Here is one more complementary coding techniques:\
