## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration
I was inspired by *[The Work of Michael Murphy](https://www.perceptualart.com/)*. This illusion art achieves a 3D visual effect through perspective and distortion.\

![Anamorphic Art 3](readmeImages/Anamorphic%20Art%203.png)\
![Anamorphic Art 4](readmeImages/Anamorphic%20Art%204.png)\
These artworks gave me some ideas for my work:\
-I hope to incorporate this **3D visual effect** into my project.\
-As users drag the screen and rotate the graphics, the pieces align and reveal a breathtaking image. Users can deeply experience the **immersive feeling** brought by the artwork.\
-Also, **fragmented images** can be composed of **metaphorical objects** to convey the essence of the work more effectively.\
